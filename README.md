## ✨ Key Features

-   **🧠 Conversational Memory:** The chatbot can understand follow-up questions, pronouns, and context from the ongoing conversation, powered by a persistent Redis database backend.
-   **📄 Multi-Modal Data Processing:** Goes beyond simple text extraction by using `unstructured.io`'s sophisticated local inference models to parse complex PDF layouts.
-   **🖼️ Vision-Enabled Summarization:** When "Enhanced Processing" is activated, the app leverages OpenAI's `gpt-4-turbo` model to generate detailed, accurate summaries of diagrams, charts, and tables within the document.
-   **🔍 Hybrid Search for Maximum Relevance:** Employs an `EnsembleRetriever` that combines the strengths of dense vector search (for semantic meaning) and traditional keyword search (BM25, for specific terms), ensuring the most relevant context is always found.
-   **⚡ High-Speed, High-Quality Generation:** Utilizes the Groq API with the Llama 3 70B model to generate answers with extremely low latency.
-   **🛡️ Robust and Grounded:** A comprehensive system prompt ensures all answers are strictly based on the document's content, preventing hallucinations and providing safe, reliable responses.
-   **☁️ Fully Deployed:** The application is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud, demonstrating a complete development-to-production workflow.
